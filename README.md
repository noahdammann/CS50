# CS50x - Harvard's introduction to Computer Science Course

## About This Course

This is CS50x, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50x, CS50, is Harvard's largest course. [Harvard course website](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science).

## Noteworthy Projects

#### [Scratch](/Week0) - (Week 0)
  - Scratch is a user-friendly, visual programming language that introduces coding concepts through a drag-and-drop interface.
  - This project holds a special place in my heart because it was the first program I wrote.

#### [Inheritance](/Week5/inheritance) - (Week 5)
  - Written in C programming language.
  - Determines the inheritance of the blood type allele for each member of a family.

#### [Finance](/Week9/finance) - (Week 9)
  - A full-stack web application built using Flask.
  - Includes user authentication, database management and security.
  - Utilizes external financial APIs to fetch real-time stock prices and market data.

## Conclusion

CS50x was my introduction into the world of programming. In this course I learned many things and gained many skills, including the following:
  - Experience programming in C (procedural) and python (object-oriented) programming languages.
  - SQL for storing and processing information in a database.
  - Web development with Flask.
  - A broad understanding of how computers work (e.g. bits, data types and memory).
  - Familiarity with concepts like recursion, HTTP and APIs.
  - Experience with Git for version control and collaboration.
  - Security fundamentals (e.g. SQL injection attacks, CSRF, password hashing and encryption).
